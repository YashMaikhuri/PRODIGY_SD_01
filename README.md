create a program that converts temperature between celsius, fahreneit, and kelvin scales. The program should prompt the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert the temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user. For ex- if a user enters a temperature of 25 degrees celsius, the program should convert it to fahrenheit and kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.
